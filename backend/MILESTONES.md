# Backend Development Milestones for a World-Class Product

This document outlines the suggested milestones to evolve the AI IELTS Examiner backend into a world-class, production-ready service. The current architecture is solid, modular, and provides an excellent foundation. These milestones focus on enhancing reliability, intelligence, and scalability.

### Milestone 1: Production-Grade Reliability and Observability

The immediate next step is to make the service robust, transparent, and ready for a production environment.

1.  **Implement Structured Logging**:
    *   **Problem**: The current system uses `print()` for logging, which is unstructured and difficult to manage in production.
    *   **Suggestion**: Integrate a structured logging library like **`structlog`**. This will format logs as JSON, enabling powerful searching, monitoring, and alerting with services like Datadog, Grafana Loki, or AWS CloudWatch.

2.  **Introduce Robust Configuration Management**:
    *   **Problem**: Configuration is loaded directly from environment variables without validation.
    *   **Suggestion**: Use **`pydantic-settings`** to define a `Settings` model. This will automatically load, parse, and validate all required environment variables on startup, preventing the application from starting with an invalid configuration.

3.  **Add a Health Check Endpoint**:
    *   **Problem**: There is no way for an orchestrator (like Kubernetes) to programmatically determine if the service is healthy.
    *   **Suggestion**: Add a simple, unauthenticated HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/healthz`) to the agent service. This endpoint should return a `200 OK` status if the application is running and can connect to critical dependencies like the Supabase database.

### Milestone 2: Deeper AI Personalization and Intelligence

To create a truly premium user experience, the agent's intelligence and personalization must be significantly enhanced.

1.  **Implement Dynamic, Contextual Follow-up Questions**:
    *   **Problem**: The Part 3 discussion is limited to a single, pre-selected question, which can feel rigid.
    *   **Suggestion**: Create a new agent tool, such as `generate_follow_up_question(topic, user_response)`. After the user's Part 2 answer, the agent would use this tool to generate a relevant, open-ended follow-up question, making the conversation feel more natural and dynamic.

2.  **Create Long-Term Question Memory**:
    *   **Problem**: The current random selection does not prevent users from getting the same questions over multiple sessions.
    *   **Suggestion**: Enhance the `students` table in Supabase with a `used_questions` JSONB column. The `select_session_questions` function would then be updated to filter out previously asked questions, guaranteeing novelty and improving long-term engagement.

3.  **Integrate Specialized Pronunciation Analysis**:
    *   **Problem**: Pronunciation feedback is based on the LLM's general assessment, which can be subjective.
    *   **Suggestion**: For a premium feature, integrate a dedicated pronunciation analysis API. A new tool could send audio segments to this service to receive detailed, phoneme-level feedback on accuracy, intonation, and stress, providing users with highly actionable, data-driven insights.

### Milestone 3: Scalability and Performance Optimization

As the user base grows, the backend must be able to handle the increased load efficiently.

1.  **Migrate to an Asynchronous Database Driver**:
    *   **Problem**: The `psycopg2` library is synchronous, and its I/O operations block the main async event loop, limiting concurrency.
    *   **Suggestion**: Replace `psycopg2` with a fully asynchronous driver like **`asyncpg`**. This is a critical step for building a highly scalable, non-blocking backend that can handle many more concurrent users.

2.  **Implement Database Connection Pooling**:
    *   **Problem**: The current implementation creates a new database connection for every query, which is inefficient and slow.
    *   **Suggestion**: Use a connection pool to manage and reuse database connections. `asyncpg` has built-in support for this. Creating a pool at startup and having all database functions borrow from it will significantly reduce latency and the load on the database.
