## 🔍 Your Data Format Analysis

### ✅ **Perfectly Compatible Structure**

Your data format matches exactly what the system expects:

```json
{
  "answers": {
    "Part 1": {
      "questions": ["Could you tell me a little bit about where you grew up?", ...],
      "responses": ["I live in the hometown guards, the police.", ...]
    },
    "Part 2": {
      "topic": "Describe a skill that you learned that helped you in your studies.",
      "response": "Yes, so the skill that I am going to talk about is collaboration..."
    },
    "Part 3": {
      "questions": ["What are some other important skills that people are learning these days?", ...],
      "responses": ["With the advent of AI, we need to know about prompt engineering.", ...]
    }
  },
  "feedback": {
    "fluency": "Gopika, you maintained a generally good pace throughout the test...",
    "grammar": "You used a mix of simple and complex sentence structures...",
    "vocabulary": "Your vocabulary was adequate for most topics...",
    "pronunciation": "Your pronunciation was generally clear and understandable..."
  },
  "strengths": [
    "Clear articulation of individual words.",
    "Good topic development in Part 2, even with some hesitation.",
    "Ability to understand and respond to abstract questions in Part 3.",
    "Good use of topic-specific vocabulary related to your work and AI."
  ],
  "test_date": "2025-07-04T08:23:58.831446",
  "band_score": 6,
  "test_number": 1,
  "improvements": [
    "Fluency and Coherence: Reduce hesitation and the use of filler words...",
    "Lexical Resource: Expand vocabulary to avoid repetition...",
    "Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Focus on improving sentence structure...",
    "Pronunciation: Pay attention to word and sentence stress..."
  ],
  "detailed_scores": {
    "fluency": 6,
    "grammar": 6,
    "vocabulary": 6,
    "pronunciation": 6
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Automatic Normalization

The system automatically converts your external format to the internal canonical format:

### Detailed Scores Mapping
- `fluency` → `fluency_coherence`
- `grammar` → `grammatical_accuracy` 
- `vocabulary` → `lexical_resource`
- `pronunciation` → `pronunciation`

### Feedback Structure Mapping
- Your flat feedback structure is automatically converted to the nested `detailed_feedback` structure
- Strengths and improvements arrays are preserved exactly as provided

## ✅ **Verified Working Tests**

The existing test suite includes a test that uses your exact data format:

```python
# From tests/test_agent_tools.py::test_save_test_result_complex_sample_data
complex_test_result = {
    "answers": {
        "Part 1": {
            "questions": ["Can you tell me a little bit about your hometown?"],
            "responses": ["I'm from Aluva, in Thrissur."]
        },
        "Part 2": {
            "topic": "Describe a skill that you learned that helped you in your studies.",
            "response": "One of the tricks I actually learned..."
        },
        "Part 3": {
            "questions": ["What are some new skills that people are learning these days?"],
            "responses": ["I think working with AI is a skill..."]
        }
    },
    "feedback": {
        "fluency": "You maintained good flow throughout the test...",
        "grammar": "You used a mix of simple and complex sentence structures.",
        "vocabulary": "Your vocabulary range is strong and appropriate...",
        "pronunciation": "Your pronunciation is clear and easy to understand."
    },
    "strengths": ["Clear and generally well-paced speech.", ...],
    "band_score": 6.5,
    "improvements": ["Grammatical Accuracy: Focus on improving accuracy...", ...],
    "detailed_scores": {
        "fluency": 6.5,
        "grammar": 6,
        "vocabulary": 7,
        "pronunciation": 7
    }
}
```
