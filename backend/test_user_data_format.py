And when we are working as a team, we can solve problems much faster than we can when we are working alone. So when many heads work together, It is always beneficial. So there are instances especially in my job where we can do pair programming. So if we don't know how to work as a team, it is not at all useful. Like no company would want us. If you are not able to gel with the other team members, then we cannot work in a company.
