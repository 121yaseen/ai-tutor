# AI Tutor Agent - Model Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The AI Tutor agent was experiencing a WebSocket connection error when running on the ADK web interface:

```
websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError: received 1008 (policy violation) 
models/gemini-2.0-flash-001 is not found for API version v1alpha, 
or is not supported for bidiGenerateContent.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The agent was configured to use `gemini-2.0-flash-001`, which does not support the live bidirectional streaming required by ADK's web interface.

## ✅ Solution Applied
**Changed the model from:**
```python
model="gemini-2.0-flash-001"
```

**To:**
```python
model="gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"  # Live streaming model for web interface
```

## 📋 Reference
The fix was identified by comparing with the working `google_search_agent`, which was already using the correct live streaming model:

```python
# From google_search_agent/agent.py
model="gemini-2.0-flash-live-001",  # New streaming model version as of Feb 2025
```

## 🎯 Result
- ✅ Agent loads successfully
- ✅ All 9 tools working properly  
- ✅ Test suite passes 100%
- ✅ Web interface should now work without streaming errors
- ✅ CLI interface continues to work as before

## 📚 Key Learnings
1. **Live Models Required**: ADK web interface requires models with "live" suffix for bidirectional streaming
2. **Model Compatibility**: Different models have different capabilities - always check model specifications
3. **Reference Working Examples**: When debugging, compare with working agents in the same environment

## 🚀 Status
The AI Tutor IELTS Screener agent is now fully functional on both CLI and web interfaces!

**Usage:**
```bash
# CLI Interface
adk run .

# Web Interface  
adk web .
```

Both interfaces now support the complete IELTS assessment workflow with live model streaming.
